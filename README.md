# AdventureWorks-BI-Report

AdventureWorks Cycles is a fictional manufacturing company. And here we have transformed raw data into professional-quality reports and dashboards to track KPIs, compare regional performance, analyze product-level trends, and identify high-value customers.

we have done the following steps :- 
data prep, data modeling, exploratory data analysis, data visualization & dashboard design

# STAGE 1: Connecting & Shaping Data

In this stage we focused on building automated workflows to extract, clean, transform, and load project data using Power Query, and explore common data connectors, storage modes, profiling tools, table transformations, and more:



Data connectors

Storage & import modes

Query editing tools

Table transformations

Connecting to a database

Extracting data from the web

QA & Profiling tools

Text, numerical, date & time tools

Rolling calendars

Index & conditional columns

Grouping & aggregating

Pivoting & unpivoting

Merging & appending queries

Data source parameters

Importing Excel models



# STAGE 2: Creating a Relational Data Model

In stage 2 we reviewed data modeling best practices, introduce topics like cardinality, normalization, filter flow and star schemas, and begin to build AdventureWorks data model from the ground up:



Database normalization

Fact & dimension tables

Primary & foreign keys

Star & snowflake schemas

Active & inactive relationships

Relationship cardinality

Filter context & flow

Bi-directional filters

Model layouts

Data formats & categories

Hierarchies



# STAGE 3: Adding Calculated Fields with DAX

In stage 3 we introduced data analysis expressions (DAX). We created calculated columns and measures, explored topics like row and filter context, and practice applying powerful tools like filter functions, iterators, and time intelligence patterns:



DAX vs. M

Calculated columns & measures

Implicit, explicit & quick measures

Measure calculation steps

DAX syntax & operators

Math & stats functions

Conditional & logical functions

The SWITCH function

Text functions

Date & time functions

The RELATED function

CALCULATE, FILTER & ALL

Iterator (X) functions

Time intelligence patterns



# STAGE 4: Visualizing Data with Reports

Stage 4 is about bringing data to LIFE with reports and dashboards. We reviewed data viz best practices, building and format basic charts, and add interactivity with bookmarks, slicer panels, parameters, tooltips, report navigation, and more:



Data viz best practices

Dashboard design framework

Cards & KPIs

Line charts, trend lines & forecasts

On-object formatting

Table & matrix visuals

Conditional formatting

Top N filtering

Map visuals

Drill up, drill down & drillthrough

Report slicers & interactions

Bookmarks & page navigation

Numeric & fields parameters

Custom tooltips

Importing custom visuals

Managing & viewing roles (RLS)

Mobile layouts

Publishing to Power BI Service




We also introduced brand new features as they are released, powerful artificial Intelligence tools like decomposition trees, key influencers, smart narratives and natural language Q&A.
